# Kuzushiji-MNIST  - VGG, ResNet & Capsule Net Classifiers


The [Kuzushiji-MNIST](https://github.com/rois-codh/kmnist) is a new alternative dataset for the well-known MNIST. The new dataset can serve as a new benchmark system for classification algorithms and can help restoring millions of books from the almost lost Japanese language - Kuzushiji. 

The [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.01718) describes the dataset, its extraction process and a few use cases and results.  
A summary of the paper can be found here.

This code presents state-of-the-results (98.9%) on Kuzushiji-MNIST using an ensemble of VGG Network and ResNet. The code uses PyTorch and FastAI (v1). 

It also provides a Kuzushiji-MNIST Dataset class to help others use the new dataset.
